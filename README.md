# LipReader.io

LipReader.io is a sophisticated deep learning application that uses state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to transcribe lip movements into text. It is designed to help in situations where audio is not available or clear, providing a textual transcription based on visual information only.

## Features

- **Deep Learning Model**: Utilizes CNNs and LSTM networks to analyze lip movements and accurately transcribe them into text.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved a remarkable 95.2% accuracy rate on the GRID corpus for the sentence-level, overlapped speaker split task, surpassing the capabilities of experienced human lipreaders.
- **Technological Stack**: Built using Python, TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV.

## Technologies Used

- **Machine Learning Frameworks**: TensorFlow, Keras
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Image Processing Library**: OpenCV
